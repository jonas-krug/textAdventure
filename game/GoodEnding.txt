With the test subject in your back you walk slowly into your car, put him in the co-pilot seat and then begin to drive.
While returning home, you begin to ask him questions about how was everything and what cruel experiments did the scientist did with him.
After a two hour long trip, you got to the agency where photos of him were taken and evidence was proven.
Action was taken inmediatly and helicopters arrove to the scientist house, where he was still sleeping...
Cure was infused after that and memories from his previous life before brought back, and he was able to testify even more evidence.
It seemed that he was a family guy who was supposed dead in Denver.
He went back with his family to live a happy life.
Meanwhile, you got a raise on your sallary and went to your bed wondering what your next mission will be...
Thanks for playing! :D
