As soon as you enter those curs√®d words on the computer, the computer's hum grows to a roar, and smoke starts pouring out of the case. Sparks start flying, and the room starts reeking of death. 
You barely realize what is going on, and start backpedaling from the demonic machine, when your ears start ringing and your whole world goes red.

Suddenly, you jolt in your seat, nearly falling to the floor. You blink twice, trying to remember the dark corners of the Earth your thoughts had raced uncontrollably to. 
You let out a deep sigh, and slam your face on the keyboard. The mind is truly a dangerous thing, if it is left free to roam unchecked. "Never again" are the words that leave your mouth. 
With newfound conviction, you erase all the cursed words and code that invaded your project just moments prior. Why the hell would you use C++ to make a game and not use classes?
Your fingers dive on the keyboard with loud clicks, and your new project starts taking shape. 
Soon, it will take the world by storm, one graphical adventure at a time.

To be continued...
