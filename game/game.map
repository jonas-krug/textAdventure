You notice a strange looking man shaking and in the moment you come close to investigate what's going on you hear a deep breath from behind and suddenly you get knocked.

Hmm, there is a room on north that might be useful to examine and a locked room on south that seems that will be unlocked later. Wait, who thinks like that? And somehow I know I will think it everytime I pass through here. Huh, weird.

You come walking silently just. You peek up a bit downstairs and see the scientific still working on his experiments (I think he thought you wouldn't solve the puzzle that easily). You aim your gun and then shoot. He twitches a bit and then falls asleep to the floor, he will be like that for a bit. You find a key that has a label that says "entrance". Better get find test subject and leave with the entrance on the first floor before is too late. The key fell right on the stairs.

It is partly destoyed. You can only read one entry. It reads: Day 998: Test subject dies after 10 days of infection, that works, however, it is pretty obvious that he was sick, he began shaking and loosing memory. There are still things to upgrade.
