Test subject struggled to get into the car as he was scratching you violently before getting in.
He was screaming "I don't want to go, I don't want to go" repeatedly, as you turned on the car.
He was shaking as he was freezing cold as you drove to the highway.
You turned on your phone as you activated the voice notes to start a quick interrogation.
He refused and grabs your phone and begins biting it.
You turn your head and question yourself if it was a good idea to bring him as evidence.
"I want to go home", he exclaims and begins alterating more and more.
And when you try to calm him down, he turns the car wheel.

No report was ever made, and no one will ever remember Agent Pierce.
